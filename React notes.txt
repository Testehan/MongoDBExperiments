1. How to create a new React app?
    - run "npm create vite" in the React folder
    - enter the project name, then select React and then TypeScript or Javascript (for tinder app i selected Javascript
    and for learning app i selected Typescript)
    - then you should follow the instructions from the terminal...go to the new directory and run "npm install"...this
    installs all the 3rd party dependencies
    - then you can run "npm run dev" to run the app

2. How does the project structure look like ?
    - node_modules contains libraries and other tools that react app needs...you will never touch that folder
    - public folder contains all sort of public assets like images videos and so on
    - src will contain our react components
    - index.html contains  <div id="root"></div> which is a container of all the contents of our app. also
    "<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>" mentions the file main.tsx which is the entry point in our app
    - package.json contains information about our app and dependencies (pom.xml from maven)

3. The code from components is called JSX, which comes from Javascript XML
        function Message() {
            return <h1>Hello dan</h1>;
        }
    In jsx code we can only use HTML elements or other React components
    This code will get translated to javascript. In order to see translated code, go to
    https://babeljs.io/  and put your JSX code
    Babel or some similar mechanism is needed because browsers don't know how to interpret JSX code, so the need
    for a translator mechanism

4. vite monitors our code files, and whenever there are changes to them, it will automatically show changes in the browser

5. How to add other libraries to your project ?
    npm i bootstrap@5.2.3           // this installs bootstrap which is used for styling..

6. instead of using a  <Fragment>, one can simply use <> and the the closing </>
